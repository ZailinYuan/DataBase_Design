# DataBase_Design
Relational database design using java

* Implement SQLite with Java
  1. The database must be used by command line. It contains functions like insert, query, update, delete with or without selection condition. 
  2. Meta-data are contained in the database file systems.
  3. The database is based on file system of Bit string I/O. A file system composed of pages of size 512B are realized. All operations (insert, query, update and delete) are based on bit string operation on database files.
  4. Index file system based on B+ tree is also developed for high performance of query records in database.
