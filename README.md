Relational database design using java

* Implement SQLite with Java
•	The database must be used by command line. It contains functions like insert, query, update, delete with or without selection condition. 
•	Meta-data are contained in the database file systems.
•	The database is based on file system of Bit string I/O. A file system composed of pages of size 512B are realized. All operations (insert, query, update and delete) are based on bit string operation on database files.
•	Index file system based on B+ tree is also developed for high performance of query records in database.
